## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision Outcome

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), utilising the [RADR toolset](https://github.com/domudall/radr).
